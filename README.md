DwarfHeightmap-coffeescript
===========================

Dwarf Fortress Heightmap Generator, in coffeescript.

An online tool for easy generation of custom world maps for Dwarf Fortress. Pick your world size, upload an image, and export, then paste the generated code in world_gen.txt

Images will be dynamically scaled to fit the world map size you need. If the sea level appears too low, change the offset. If you want to adjust the contrast, experiment with the ratio variable.
